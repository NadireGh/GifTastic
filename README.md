# GifTastic

### The application loads a set of feeling/emotion words. Clicking one will load a random set of 10 still GIPHY images. Clicking on the image will active it; clicking again will stop it. User also can enter their own emotion in the search box, and it will add that word to the list as a button and, when clicked, will populate an additional 10 GIPHY on the page.

### Tools I use :
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* AJAX technique
* GIPHY API

### In Java Script
* Create an array of topics that will be used to build original buttons
* Loop through the topics array and create a button for each feeling, then append to page
* Display the called giphy images on the page using AJAX
* Toggle between still and animated images
* Create a function to allow user input and add that to the array so a button can be made
* allows user to hit enter instead of mouse click on submit to generate new button
* Display the giphy images onto the page in the <div displayGiphy>
